## Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently spending most of my time learning Python and SQL. I've also learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript and React.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data projects and business projects (particularly related to sports, music, or food). I also love working on mobile and web apps.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with continuing to build strong development and data fundamentals.
- 💬 Ask me about coding, sports, cookings, or music!
- 📫 How to reach me: ruitaocchen@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can name the US Presidents in order, solve a Rubik's Cube in 30 seconds, and juggle.
